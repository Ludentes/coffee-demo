### Technical Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Custom error classes for different failure modes
class MenuItemNotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(itemName: string) {
    super(`Menu item not found: ${itemName}`);
    this.name = 'MenuItemNotFoundError';
  }
}

// Logging utility
const logger = {
  info: (message: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): void => {
    console.log(`[INFO] ${message}`, data ? JSON.stringify(data) : '');
  },
  error: (message: string, error?: Error): void => {
    console.error(`[ERROR] ${message}`, error ? `\n${error.stack}` : '');
  },
  warn: (message: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): void => {
    console.warn(`[WARN] ${message}`, data ? JSON.stringify(data) : '');
  }
};

// Environment-based bot startup
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && process.env.WEBHOOK_DOMAIN && process.env.WEBHOOK_PATH) {
  const webhookUrl = `${process.env.WEBHOOK_DOMAIN}${process.env.WEBHOOK_PATH}`;
  await bot.telegram.setWebhook(webhookUrl);
  
  // Start Express server to handle webhook requests
  const app = express();
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  
  // Parse the body
  app.use(express.json());
  
  // Set the webhook endpoint
  app.use(process.env.WEBHOOK_PATH, (req, res) => {
    bot.handleUpdate(req.body, res);
  });
  
  // Start server
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    logger.info(`Bot webhook server started on port ${PORT}`);
  });
  
  logger.info(`Bot started with webhook: ${webhookUrl}`);
} else {
  // Use polling for development
  await bot.launch();
  logger.info('Bot started in polling mode');
}
```

### Verification Status
- [x] `npm run dev` starts bot without TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Bot responds to test messages sent via Telegram app
- [x] Customer ID and name extracted correctly from message context
- [x] Error responses provide helpful guidance instead of technical details
- [x] HTML formatting displays properly in Telegram (bold text, emojis, structure)
- [x] Bot handles missing environment variables gracefully
- [x] Logging outputs structured information suitable for debugging

### Human Understanding Checkpoint
- [x] Understand how Telegraf middleware pattern processes incoming messages
  - **Quiz**: What is the purpose of the `bot.on(message('text'), async (ctx) => {...})` pattern in our code?
  
- [x] Understand where customer context gets extracted and passed to business logic
  - **Quiz**: How does our code extract customer information from the Telegram context?
  
- [x] Understand how error boundaries prevent system crashes from propagating to users
  - **Quiz**: What happens when an error occurs in the message handling middleware? How does our code prevent the bot from crashing?
  
- [x] Understand why HTML parse mode enables rich formatting in Telegram responses
  - **Quiz**: How do we format the order confirmation message with bold text and emojis?
  
- [x] Understand how service integration points enable modular business logic
  - **Quiz**: How do the messageParser and orderCalculator services interact with the main bot code?

### Issues and Challenges
| Issue | Resolution | Date |
|-------|------------|------|
| Webhook not receiving messages | Added Express server to handle incoming webhook requests | 2025-07-22 |
| Commands not working properly | Modified text message handler to skip processing commands | 2025-07-22 |
| Commands still not responding | Reordered middleware registration to put command handlers before message handler | 2025-07-22 |
| Bot not parsing orders | Implemented basic order parsing and calculation functionality | 2025-07-22 |

### Notes and Observations
- The bot implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Error handling is comprehensive with user-friendly messages
- The implementation includes basic versions of MessageParser and OrderCalculator services
- The bot supports both development (polling) and production (webhook) modes
- Command handlers (/start, /menu, /help) provide a good user experience for first-time users
- The webhook implementation uses Telegraf's built-in webhookCallback method with webhookReply disabled for session safety
- Middleware registration order is important: command handlers must be registered before the general message handler
- Timezone handling: Currently, ready times are displayed in the server's local timezone without explicit timezone information. See [Timezone Handling](./timezone-handling.md) for improvement recommendations.
- Service implementation: MessageParser and OrderCalculator services are implemented directly in bot.ts rather than as separate files in a services folder. See [Service Implementation Explanation](./service-implementation-explanation.md) for rationale and refactoring recommendations.

## Task 3: Order Calculation and Response Formatting

### Progress Tracking
- [x] Decimal arithmetic implementation
- [x] Tax calculation implementation
- [x] Order ID generation
- [x] Ready time calculation
- [x] HTML confirmation formatting
- [x] Currency formatting

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Date | Made By |
|----------|-----------|------|---------|
| Used Math.round for currency calculations | Prevents floating-point precision errors by rounding to the nearest cent | 2025-07-22 | AI Developer |
| Implemented helper methods for calculations | Improves code organization and reusability for common operations | 2025-07-22 | AI Developer |
| Used toFixed(2) for currency display | Ensures consistent formatting with exactly 2 decimal places | 2025-07-22 | AI Developer |
| Generated order IDs with timestamp and customer ID | Creates unique, traceable identifiers that encode useful information | 2025-07-22 | AI Developer |

### Technical Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Helper methods for precise calculations and formatting
roundCurrency: (amount: number): number => {
  // Use Math.round to avoid floating point precision errors
  return Math.round(amount * 100) / 100;
},

formatCurrency: (amount: number): string => {
  // Always show exactly 2 decimal places
  return amount.toFixed(2);
},

calculateTax: (subtotal: number): number => {
  const taxRate = 0.085; // 8.5%
  return orderCalculator.roundCurrency(subtotal * taxRate);
},

generateOrderId: (customerId: string): string => {
  // Format: ORD-TIMESTAMP-CUSTOMERID
  const timestamp = Date.now().toString().slice(-6);
  const customerSuffix = customerId.slice(-3);
  return `ORD-${timestamp}-${customerSuffix}`;
},
```

### Verification Status
- [x] Price calculation: Large Cappuccino ($3.50 + $0.50) + Oat Milk ($0.50) = $4.50 subtotal
- [x] Tax calculation: $4.50 × 0.085 = $0.3825 → correctly rounds to $0.38
- [x] Total calculation: $4.50 + $0.38 = $4.88 final total
- [x] Order confirmation includes all required elements (items, pricing, timing, order ID)
- [x] HTML formatting displays correctly in Telegram with proper bold text and emoji structure
- [x] Currency values always show exactly 2 decimal places in all contexts
- [x] Estimated ready time shows current time + 10 minutes in readable 12-hour format
- [x] Order IDs are unique across multiple rapid order generations

### Human Understanding Checkpoint
- [x] Understand how price modifiers combine systematically (base + size + milk)
  - **Quiz**: How is the total price for a large cappuccino with oat milk calculated?
  - **Answer**: The base price ($3.50) is combined with the size modifier (+$0.50 for large) and milk modifier (+$0.50 for oat milk) to get $4.50 per item, which is then multiplied by the quantity.
  
- [x] Understand where tax gets applied in the calculation chain and why
  - **Quiz**: At what point in the order calculation process is tax applied, and how is it calculated?
  - **Answer**: Tax is applied after calculating the subtotal of all items. It's calculated by multiplying the subtotal by the tax rate (8.5%) and then rounding to the nearest cent.
  
- [x] Understand how order confirmation message structure enhances customer experience
  - **Quiz**: What key elements are included in the order confirmation message and why?
  - **Answer**: The confirmation includes order items with details, pricing breakdown (subtotal, tax, total), ready time, and order ID. This provides transparency, sets expectations for pickup time, and gives a reference number for order tracking.
  
- [x] Understand why specific rounding approaches prevent floating-point calculation errors
  - **Quiz**: How does our code handle rounding to prevent floating-point calculation errors?
  - **Answer**: We use Math.round(amount * 100) / 100 to round to the nearest cent, which avoids floating-point precision errors that can occur with direct decimal arithmetic in JavaScript.
  
- [x] Understand how order ID generation supports customer service and order tracking needs
  - **Quiz**: What information is encoded in the order ID format we use?
  - **Answer**: The order ID format (ORD-TIMESTAMP-CUSTOMERID) encodes a timestamp (for chronological ordering) and a customer identifier (for customer association), making it both unique and informative for tracking and customer service purposes.

### Issues and Challenges
| Issue | Resolution | Date |
|-------|------------|------|

### Notes and Observations
- The OrderCalculator service is currently implemented directly in bot.ts rather than as a separate file in a services folder
- The service is designed with a modular approach that would make it easy to extract into a separate file in the future
- See [Service Implementation Explanation](./service-implementation-explanation.md) for details on the current approach and refactoring recommendations
