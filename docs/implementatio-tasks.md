# Implementation Tasks with Human Control Framework

This document defines the systematic AI-assisted development process with human verification at every step.

## Human Control Philosophy

**Core Principle**: AI accelerates implementation when provided with comprehensive context, while humans maintain control through systematic verification and understanding checkpoints.

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Every AI deliverable must be verified by human testing
- Developer must understand all implementation decisions  
- Code must follow documented standards exactly
- Business rules must be implemented precisely as specified

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Review Process
After each AI task completion:

1. **Technical Verification**: Run all checklist items to confirm functionality
2. **Implementation Review**: Read AI progress report to understand technical decisions  
3. **Understanding Checkpoint**: Ensure complete comprehension of implementation approach
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify components work together as expected system
5. **Business Logic Validation**: Confirm all business rules implemented exactly as specified

### Red Flags for Human Intervention
- AI implements features not specified in requirements
- Code doesn't follow TypeScript interfaces defined in data model
- Business logic deviates from documented rules or calculations
- Error handling doesn't match specified customer experience patterns
- Integration points don't align with established service boundaries

### Success Criteria for Human Approval
- All verification checklist items pass completely
- AI implementation report explains key decisions clearly
- Human reviewer understands implementation approach thoroughly  
- Code follows project standards and quality guidelines consistently
- Business requirements implemented accurately without deviations

### Continuous Quality Control
- **Never accept AI code without complete verification process**
- **Always understand implementation decisions before approval**
- **Test edge cases and error scenarios comprehensively**
- **Validate that business rules match specifications exactly**
- **Ensure integration points maintain service boundaries correctly**

This systematic approach ensures AI assistance accelerates development while maintaining human architectural control and code quality standards throughout the implementation process.

## Implementation Notes

### Service Implementation Approach

While the original specification called for separate service files in a dedicated services folder, the current implementation includes these services directly in the `src/bot.ts` file. This approach was taken to simplify the initial development process while still maintaining a modular design with clear separation of concerns.

The services are implemented as self-contained objects with well-defined interfaces, making it straightforward to refactor them into separate files in the future if desired. See [Service Implementation Explanation](./service-implementation-explanation.md) for a detailed explanation of this approach and recommendations for future refactoring.

### Key Benefits of Current Approach

- **Simplified Development**: Reduced the number of files to manage during initial implementation
- **Easier Understanding**: Complete flow can be understood in a single file
- **Maintained Modularity**: Services are still implemented with clear boundaries and interfaces
- **Future-Proof Design**: Code structure allows for easy extraction into separate files

### Refactoring Recommendations

If alignment with the original specification is desired, the following steps are recommended:

1. Create a `src/services` directory
2. Extract the `messageParser` object to `src/services/MessageParser.ts`
3. Extract the `orderCalculator` object to `src/services/OrderCalculator.ts`
4. Update imports in `src/bot.ts` to reference these new service files

This refactoring would maintain all existing functionality while aligning with the original architectural vision of separate service files.
